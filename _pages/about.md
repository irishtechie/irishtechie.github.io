## Introduction

My name is Karl, a husband and father of 4 wonderful children living in Northern Ireland. I am passionate about all things IT and enjoy learning new things. When I am not working, studying for an exam, or learning something new, I can be found watching Star Trek or spending time with my family. We enjoy exploring Ireland and finding new places to play.

## What I do

I am an Implementation Specialist at Action Point Technology Group specialising in the Azure and Microsoft 365 technology areas. My role involves designing and implementing Microsoft-based solutions for businesses of all shapes and sizes.

I enjoy the divergent nature of my role as it means that I am working with many different technology areas from Azure Services and Infrastructure to Microsoft 365 and Modern Workplace technologies.

## Why I Blog

I've been talking about starting a blog for years but, as my wife will attest, I tend to procrastinate. The primary purpose behind this blog is to share my experiences as an IT Professional, both technical and not.

I believe that we, as human beings, are stronger when we work together. Community is important. I look forward to contributing to the IT Community by sharing these insights.

I'll be writing about what I learn as I work with Azure and M365. You can expect blogs on different Azure and M365 services as well as articles that follow my journey from self-confessed "portal clicker" to being comfortable with automation and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Certificates

There is often a lot of debate around the benefits of professional certifications within the IT Pro community. I have always found them very useful when coupled with experience in the field.

### Earned

I currently hold the following certifications:

* Cisco CCNA (Routing and Switching)
* Microsoft MCSA: Office 365
* Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate
* Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate

### In Progress

As I udpate this, in January 2021, I have taken a slight detour from my AZ-303 studies to work on the AZ-400 "Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions" exam.
