With thanks to [Writers’ HQ](https://writershq.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}, our supreme writing commanders, glorious leaders and excellent but tiny overlords, who have verily granted us permission to use their splendid and sweary Privacy Policy.

## TL;DR

I'm one man with a full-time IT job, 4 Children and a Wife, I don’t have the time or energy to do anything nefarious with your data. It’s not that I'm not evil – I'm probably as corruptible as anyone – I'm just too tired to think up a malevolent plot to steal your identity. To be honest, I'd rather be reading tech blogs or watching Star Trek!

## Cookies

Seriously who actually cares? Do you even know what a cookie is or does? Well then. Yes we use cookies because that’s kinda how the Internet works. If you don’t want our delicious home-baked chocolate chip scripts, then you need to block cookies on your browser but don’t come crying to us when nothing does what it’s supposed to.

## Stalky Visitor Tracking

Look, we’re following you, ok? We use Google Analytics, primarily to stare at the real time stats because they’re cool but also to see what stuff people looking at so we can write more of the stuff you like.

We also use AddThis which shows us what content people are sharing. This is because we like to know which content is doing the best. You can’t block this because it’s not tracking you, it’s tracking our content.

None of these things store any super personal data about you but they, probably, nab your IP address, not that we’d know where to look for it or what to do with it. All we see is that a person or many people have interacted with the website in a particular way. You can mess with us by doing something totally unexpected on the website and skewing our stats. Or you could do something way more fun and useful with your time LIKE WRITING.

## Data Storage

**DATA!!** It’s all about the data, baby. A literal tonne of petabytes whirring around the world and what? What’s it all for? **WHAT DOES IT ALL MEAN?** What will future historians actually see of us and our slowly collapsing society? So. We store your data in a few different places and use it in a couple of different ways. You ready for this?

We’ll be honest: we do absolutely nothing surprising or radical with your info.

## Social Media

We use social media a lot, partly to promote our ramblings and musings but mostly as a vehicle for interacting with the IT Pro Community. If you comment on our posts and we become familiar with you, we might find you on Twitter and say hello. You can ask us to be less friendly if you wish and we will of course respect your boundaries.

You are not required to follow our social media accounts but you can, if you so wish. See left for for details.
