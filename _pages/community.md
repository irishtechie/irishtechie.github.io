### The Why

I believe that human beings are stronger when we work together. I believe that each of us has something that we can contribute to the communities that we are involved in. One of my goals for this year and moving forward is to give back to the IT Community by sharing my experiences and helping others who might be on similar journeys. This might come in the form of blog posts on this website, user group talks, working with other members of the community to create content and organise events.

Feel free to reach out on Twitter or LinkedIn if you'd like to collaborate. You'll find links to my socials at the bottom of this page.
