### The Why

I believe that human beings are stronger when we work together. I believe that each of us has something that we can contribute to the communities that we are involved in. One of my goals for this year and moving forward is to give back to the IT Community by sharing my experiences and helping others who might be on similar journeys. This might come in the form of blog posts on this website, user group talks, working with other members of the community to create content and organise events.

Feel free to reach out on Twitter or LinkedIn if you'd like to collaborate. You'll find links to my socials at the bottom of this page.

### The What

In this section you will find details of any events happening in the community that I might be involved in or that I think deserve some love. Reach out if you want your event posted here.

###### Monday 7th June: Live Call with Chris Reddington

On Monday 7th June, I joined Chris Reddington ([@reddobowen](https://twitter.com/reddobowen){:target="_blank"}) for another live call to discuss using Azure Storage, Azure CDN, GitHub Actions, and Hugo to deliver an awesome blog platform.

This time we did an in-depth session on the GitHub Actions workflows that automate a lot of the publishing process Chris uses with his site ([www.cloudwithchris.com](https://www.cloudwithchris.com/){:target="_blank"}).

It was a really interesting discussion! If you want to know more about GitHub Actions and how it can help your blogging, then check out the recording below.
