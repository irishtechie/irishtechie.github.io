### The Why

I believe that human beings are stronger when we work together. I believe that each of us has something that we can contribute to the communities that we are involved in. One of my goals for this year and moving forward is to give back to the IT Community by sharing my experiences and helping others who might be on similar journeys. This might come in the form of blog posts on this website, user group talks, working with other members of the community to create content and organise events.

Feel free to reach out on Twitter or LinkedIn if you'd like to collaborate. You'll find links to my socials at the bottom of this page.

### The What

In this section you will find details of any events happening in the community that I might be involved in or that I think deserve some love. Reach out if you want your event posted here.

#### Limerick DotNet Azure User Group

At the start of the year, I joined the Team at the Limerick DotNet Azure User group as a co-organiser. I've been focused on bringing speakers in to present at our monthly events. We've had some great speakers this year so far and look forward to more.

###### Thursday 22nd April: Live Call with Chris Reddington

On Thursday 22nd April, I'll be joining Chris Reddington ([@reddobowen](https://twitter.com/reddobowen){:target="_blank"}) for a live call to discuss using Azure Storage, Azure CDN, GitHub Actions, and Hugo to deliver an awesome blog platform.

We'll go into some detail on the decisions and reasoning behind the choice to run his site ([www.cloudwithchris.com](https://www.cloudwithchris.com/){:target="_blank"}) in Azure. We'll also discuss the automated GitHub Actions workflows that Chris uses to publish new content to his site.
