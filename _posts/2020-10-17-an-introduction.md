So, I've finally gotten round to starting a blog!

For those that don't know me, my name is Karl. I work as an Implementation Specialist for Action Point Technology Group in Ireland. I've been working in the IT industry for about 10 years in various roles from running my own small (read: very small) business to working my way up through the helpdesk to the Professional Services and Project work that I am doing now.

I work primarily in the Microsoft sphere, specialising in Azure and Microsoft 365. My day to day can be quite varied which is good as it keeps things interesting. Working for a Managed Services Provider it is important to keep up to date on the various technologies in this space.

Outside of work and study, I'm married with 4 children. As a family, we enjoy exploring Ireland and finding new places to take pictures and to run wild with the kids. I'm also an avid Trekkie and, in my downtime, can be found watching something Trek or Sci-Fi related.

I'll be using this platform as a means to improve my writing skills, so constructive advice is always welcome. In terms of content, you can expect a good mix of topics covering all aspects of Azure and M365. I'll be documenting my journey into Infrastructure as Code using ARM Templates and Terraform as well as tips to secure your Azure and Modern Workplace infrastructure. I'll also be sharing blogs on the softer skills required to succeed in this industry.

Thank you for taking the time to read my introductory post. I'm looking forward to contributing to the IT Community in a positive way.
